# MultiplePromptsBotWithExit hosted in ASP.NET Core
This sample implements multiple prompts using a Waterfall[] array of steps. 
The steps represent a stack of functions that will be executed in sequence.
This code illustrates a simple method that allows you to look for user input,
and when requested, end the sequence of stack function steps within a Waterfall[] array.
This process resets your bot to begin a new user interaction.
